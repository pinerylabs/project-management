### CONTEXT

> *Delete this paragraph, and answer the questions below as well as possible.  The answers to all of these questions will be visible at the bottom of every page in the application.  You can fill out the questions one-by-one, or just cut-n-paste that text instead.*

* Which page? — 
* Which user name? — 
* What time? —
* Which version? — 

### STEPS TO REPRODUCE

> *Delete this paragraph and fill in the steps below.  Try to be as exact as possible so that I can repeat your steps on my own developer's copy of the application.  Whenever possible, tell me exactly which buttons you clicked, what text you entered in each box, which checklist you were working with, etc.  If I have trouble reproducing the problem, I may follow up with more questions, or suggestions of things to try to get more information about how to reproduce the problem.*

1. 
2. 
3. 


### ACTUAL RESULTS

> *Delete this paragraph, and describe what *really did* happen.  If several unexpected things happened on multiple steps, then call them each out stating what happened on each step.*


### WHY IS IT ANNOYING?

> *Delete this paragraph, and tell me why bothers you about how it works right now.  Don't assume that it will be obvious to me why something is annoying.  We all work differently, and what is bothersome to you might see perfectly normal to me.*
