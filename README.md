This repository contains all the project management tools for Pinery Labs.  In particular, it has:

* [Issues](https://github.com/pinerylabs/project-management/issues)—requests for improvements to
    the project (whether feature requests, bug reports or anything else).
* [Milestones](https://github.com/pinerylabs/project-management/milestones)—a set of ordered
    lists of issues arranged according to how soon they are scheduled to be added to the
    product.  The lowest numbered release is the one which will come out next.  "Triage" contains
    new items which have not yet been duely categorized and prioritized.  "Unspecified Release"
    contains items which are understood, but not planned for a particular release.  


### ADDING ISSUES

We break down issues into three types: Feature Requests, Bug Reports, and Nuisance Reports.

Feature Requests are used when asking for something new to be added to the product.  Perhaps it's a
random idea which occured to you while using the product, maybe its a simpler way of getting through
some task, or perhaps it's something another program does which you'd like to see added.  Any of
those are fair game for a Feature Request.

Bug Reports are used to call out when some existing feature isn't working as it should.  This could
be anything from a button which is disabled when it shouldn't be, a place where changes aren't saved,
or when the entire website crashes. If you think it isn't working like it should, file a Bug Report.

Nuisance Reports are used when something isn't quite broken, but it's still annoying to work with.
This could be a page which takes too long to load, something which takes too many steps, or a place
where it's hard to make a checklist look good.  If you're not sure which category to use, go ahead
and file a Nuisance Report.

To actually add an issue, click the [Issues](/issues) tab above, an then the large, green "New Issue"
button on the right.  This will prompt you to choose your issue type by selecting one of the big,
green "Get Started" buttons.



### ABOUT SPRINTS

We plan work in two-week increments, called sprints.  In each sprint, the goal is to deliver complete
new features / bug fixes / etc. in a logical group which has a clear theme.  These are called Milestones.
This might be adding a new cluster of features all to do with the same general part of the application,
a pass at making everything faster, or an effort to stamp out bugs in a certain feature.

At the beginning of each sprint, we will plan out what is going to go into the upcoming sprint.  To a
large degree, this will be based upon *your* feedback!  Whether it's through filing issues here, talking
with us directly, or letting your project leader know what you'd like to see next.  All this feedback is
captured and added to a Milestone.
