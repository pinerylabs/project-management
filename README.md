This repository contains all the project management tools for Pinery Labs.  In particular, it has:

* [Issues](https://github.com/pinerylabs/project-management/issues)—requests for improvements to
    the project (whether feature requests, bug reports or anything else).
* [Product Backlog](https://github.com/pinerylabs/project-management/projects/1)—a set of ordered
    lists of issues arranged in columns according to how soon they are scheduled to be added to the
    product, or what release they were part of.  The "Current Release" column shows things which
    are planned for the next release, and "Triage" contains items which have not yet been duely
    categorized and prioritized.


### ADDING ISSUES

We break down issues into three types: Feature Requests, Bug Reports, and Nuisance Reports.

Feature Requests are used when asking for something new to be added to the product.  Perhaps it's a
random idea which occured to you while using the product, maybe its a simpler way of getting through
some task, or perhaps it's something another program does which you'd like to see added.  Any of
those are fair game for a Feature Request.

Bug Reports are used to call out when some existing feature isn't working as it should.  This could
be anything from a button which is disabled when it shouldn't be, a place where changes aren't saved,
or when the entire website crashes. If you think it isn't working like it should, file a Bug Report.

Nuisance Reports are used when something isn't quite broken, but it's still annoying to work with.
This could be a page which takes too long to load, something which takes too many steps, or a place
where it's hard to make a checklist look good.  If you're not sure which category to use, go ahead
and file a Nuisance Report.

To actually add an issue, click the [Issues](/issues) tab above, an then the large, green "New Issue"
button on the right.  This will prompt you to choose your issue type by selecting one of the big,
green "Get Started" buttons.



### ABOUT SPRINTS

We plan work in two-week increments, called sprints.  In each sprint, the goal is to deliver complete
new features / bug fixes / etc. in a logical group which has a clear theme.  This might be adding a
new cluster of features all to do with the same general part of the application, a pass at making
everything faster, or an effort to stamp out bugs in a certain feature.

At the beginning of each sprint, Andrew will get together with the project leader(s) for each customer
and plan out what is going to go into the upcoming sprint.  To a large degree, this will be based upon
*your* feedback!  Whether it's through filing issues here, talking with me directly, or letting your
project leader know what you'd like to see next.  All this feedback is captured in the Project Backlog,
and it is sifted and sorted to product the list of issues to be addressed in the new sprint. The
selected issues are then moved to the Sprint Backlog.



### UNDERSTANDING THE PROJECT BACKLOG

The Project Backlog contains all issues—past, present, and future—organized into columns.  There are
four categories of columns:

1. Triage—this column contains issues which have not be categorized and prioritized. This is used to
accumulate issues between official sprint planning activities.
2. Releases—typically named something like "v1.2.3—Main Focus Area", these columns contain the actual
issues completed for each release of Runbooks.  The "vX.Y.Z—Current Release" column contains the issues
which are due to be completed in the next release.
3. Theme—columns starting with "Theme" collect specific items which all pertain to some one part of the
system (e.g., "Theme—Runbook Editing").  These are kept roughly in priority order of how important each
issue seems to be to end users.
