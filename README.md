This repository contains all the project management tools for Pinery Labs.  In particular, it has:

* [Issues](https://github.com/pinerylabs/project-management/issues)—requests for improvements to
    the project (whether feature requests, bug reports or anything else).
* [Product Backlog](https://github.com/pinerylabs/project-management/projects/1)—a set of ordered
    lists of issues arranged in columns according to how soon they are scheduled to be added to the
    product
* [Sprint Backlog](https://github.com/pinerylabs/project-management/projects/2)—a visual display of
    all the work currently in progress, showing what is availble for users, what is available for
    testing, and what is still in progress.



### ADDING ISSUES

We break down issues into three types: Feature Requests, Bug Reports, and Nuisance Reports.

Feature Requests are used when asking for something new to be added to the product.  Perhaps it's a
random idea which occured to you while using the product, maybe its a simpler way of getting through
some task, or perhaps it's something another program does which you'd like to see added.  Any of
those are fair game for a Feature Request.

Bug Reports are used to call out when some existing feature isn't working as it should.  This could
be anything from a button which is disabled when it shouldn't be, a place where changes aren't saved,
or when the entire website crashes. If you think it isn't working like it should, file a Bug Report.

Nuisance Reports are used when something isn't quite broken, but it's still annoying to work with.
This could be a page which takes too long to load, something which takes too many steps, or a place
where it's hard to make a checklist look good.  If you're not sure which category to use, go ahead
and file a Nuisance Report.

### ABOUT SPRINTS

We plan work in two-week increments, called sprints.  In each sprint, the goal is to deliver complete
new features / bug fixes / etc. in a logical group which has a clear theme.  This might be adding a
new cluster of features all to do with the same general part of the application, a pass at making
everything faster, or an effort to stamp out bugs in a certain feature.

At the beginning of each sprint, Andrew will get together with the project leader(s) for each customer
and plan out what is going to go into the upcoming sprint.  To a large degree, this will be based upon
*your* feedback!  Whether it's through filing issues here, talking with me directly, or letting your
project leader know what you'd like to see next.  All this feedback is captured in the Project Backlog,
and it is sifted and sorted to product the list of issues to be addressed in the new sprint. The
selected issues are then moved to the Sprint Backlog.



### UNDERSTANDING THE PROJECT BACKLOG

The Project Backlog contains all the issues *which are not* being worked on right now.  It's organized
into three columns: Triage, Next Sprint, and Future Sprints. By default, all newly created issues
are added to the Triage column. Each time we plan a new sprint, these will be moved into the other
columns. The Next Sprint column is used to capture all the work which is planned to go into the new
sprint being planned. Issues to be handled sometime after the next sprint are moved to the Future
Sprints column. Within each column, those issues deemed more urgent are sorted to the top, while those
considered less urgent are sorted to the bottom.



### UNDERSTANDING THE SPRINT BACKLOG

The Sprint Backlog contains all the issues being worked on *in the current sprint*.  It has four
columns: Planned, In Progress, Staging, and Production.  Issues in the Planning column have been selected
for the current sprint, but no one is actually working on them yet.  Issues in the In Progress column
are actively been developed.  Issues in Staging are available on the test version of the website, but
haven't yet been delivered to the real website.  Finally, issues in the Production column are live on
the official website.

Items in the Planned column are shown in order of importance: the top-most things are those which were
deemed most important to deliver during sprint planning.  This doesn't necessarily mean that they will
get worked on exactly in this order, however.  Sometimes, it makes more sense to implement two issues
together (or one before another) in a way which changes the actual order of implementation.  All the
rest of the columns show items in order of when they were moved to that column.
